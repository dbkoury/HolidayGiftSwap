# HolidayGiftSwap
I have created an algorithm to take a list of names and assign each person another person to give a gift to for the holiday season. (Some may know this as a "Secret Santa".
This repository has two versions of this algorithm:
1. A non anonymous version that prints the results and only requires a list of names
2. An anonymous version that emails each participant their person, which requires both a list of names and a list of emails, as well as an email to send from

Future versions of this document may be updated to take the data from a csv or excel file, and for the case of the anonymous email, may later be updated to include gift ideas which would advisably be collected by a google form sent to participants.
